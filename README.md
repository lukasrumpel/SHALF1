# SHALF1
small hardware abstraction library for the STM32F1 family
------------------------------------------------------------

SHALF1 is a small hardware abstraction library for STM32F1 MCUs, it is is inspired by Ralf Jesses MCAL. If you're not familiar with programming STM32 microcontrollers, i will recommend reading his book about the topic (STM32 -- ARM-Microcontroller programmieren fÃ¼r Embedded Systems: Das umfassende Praxisbuch). 
This library is currently under construction but for most functional units of the F1 family (low- and medium density Controllers -> support for others will be added!) it is working.

----------------------------------------------------------
In oder to use the SHALF1 you need the CMSIS to be installed. You can simply copy the SHALF1 Files to your Project and use them.
